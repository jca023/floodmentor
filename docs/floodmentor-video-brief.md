# FloodMentor Explainer Video Brief

**Duration:** 60-90 seconds
**Style:** Clean, professional, mobile-focused UI demo with narration
**Tone:** Confident, practical, time-saving

---

## The Problem (0:00 - 0:20)

**Visual:** Flood adjuster standing in a damaged home, clipboard in hand, trying to take notes while examining water damage. Looks frustrated, juggling phone/camera/paperwork.

**Narration:**
> "Flood adjusters spend hours documenting damage in the field. Handwritten notes. Scattered photos. Back at the office, they piece it together and hope they didn't miss anything that'll cost them in litigation."

---

## Introducing FloodMentor (0:20 - 0:35)

**Visual:** Phone screen comes into focus. FloodMentor app opens. Clean, simple interface with a big record button.

**Narration:**
> "FloodMentor changes that. One app. Voice-first. Policy-grounded. Built for the field."

---

## How It Works - Recording (0:35 - 0:50)

**Visual:** Adjuster holds phone, taps record button. Speaks naturally while looking at a wall with a visible flood line.

**On-screen text:** "Exterior front, flood line 22 inches on the brick, clear silt line and debris at the foundation."

**Narration:**
> "Just tap and talk. Describe what you see - flood line heights, evidence types, location. FloodMentor captures everything hands-free."

---

## How It Works - AI Extraction (0:50 - 1:05)

**Visual:** Phone screen shows transcript appearing, then structured data cards pop up:
- Flood line: 22 inches
- Evidence: silt line, debris mat
- Location: exterior front

**Narration:**
> "AI transcribes your voice and extracts the key facts automatically. No more deciphering your own handwriting. No more missed details."

---

## The Payoff - Defensible Documentation (1:05 - 1:20)

**Visual:** Split screen - left shows the app with saved observations, right shows a professional-looking audit report/defense packet.

**Narration:**
> "Every observation is timestamped, policy-cited, and audit-ready. When a claim gets challenged, you have the documentation to back it up."

---

## Call to Action (1:20 - 1:30)

**Visual:** FloodMentor logo centered. Tagline appears below.

**Text on screen:**
```
FloodMentor
Document. Defend. Done.
```

**Narration:**
> "FloodMentor. Document flood damage the way it should be done."

## Notes for Production

- Mobile UI should look realistic (not overly polished mockup)

- Narration should sound like an adjuster talking to another adjuster, not a sales pitch
- Keep text on screen minimal - let visuals and voice carry it
