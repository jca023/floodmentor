# FloodMentor - 20 Second Nano Banana Prompt

## Primary Prompt (copy this)

```
A professional insurance adjuster in a blue polo shirt stands next to a flood-damaged brick wall with a visible water line. He holds up his smartphone and speaks into it confidently. The phone screen shows a recording waveform. As he speaks, text appears on screen: "Flood line 22 inches, silt line, exterior front". The view transitions to the phone screen where three clean white cards animate in showing extracted data: "Height: 22 in", "Evidence: silt line", "Location: Exterior". A subtle checkmark appears. The adjuster smiles and walks to the next room, phone ready. Text fades in at bottom: "Voice-first documentation. And that's just the start." Cinematic lighting, realistic, professional corporate video, 4K quality.
